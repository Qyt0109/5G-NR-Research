# Chapter 1: 3GPP 5G NR
The **5th generation (5G) wireless access technology** address variety of **scenarios**:
- Enhanced Mobile Boardband (eMBB)
- Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (mMTC)
- Massive Machine Type Communication (ITU)

**Key features**:
- Ultra-lean transmission
- Low-latency, advanced antenna technologies
- Operation in high frequency bands
- Inter-working between high and low frequency bands
- Dynamic time division multiplexing (TDD)

**NR radio interface** consists of:
- Layer 1: physical layer *([*5G NR Physical layer General description](../Docs/5G%20NR%20Physical%20layer%20General%20description.pdf), [5G NR Physical layer procedures for data]())*
- Higher layer:
    - Medium access control
    - Radio resource control (RRC)
